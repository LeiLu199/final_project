## What is it

For our project, we wrote a Python package (**portfolioFactory**) that streamlines the process for building cross-sectional trading strategies/factors. In our examples, we show how you can 
easily creates [**momentum**][momentum] strategies (i.e. buy the winners) with different horizons as well ask explore new trading signals.
 
As discussed, we created 3 examples that make use of our package. To run the examples, you can enter the following command in the terminal: 

'''
python example1.py
'''

Data for examples are in /ExampleData. 

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that **portfolioFactory** does well:

  - Construction of asset pricing factors e.g. [**cross-sectional momentum portfolios**][momentum] 

  - Calculating risk and return metrics
  
  - Plotting
